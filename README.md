Westminster Reference Bible
===========================

With the Reformation concept of sola Scriptura and the idea of *regula fidei*,
this Bible adds over 200,000 references to aid the student of the Word of God.
It also contains references to explain words which may have changed meaning
since the publication of the KJV, and might confuse the modern reader.  This
Bible also contains helpful chapter introductions to further augment the study
experience.
